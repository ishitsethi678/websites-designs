        <p class="sectionsubtag textsmall">New programs and classes are being added to curriculum every year. For instance, the University of Connecticut launched a digital media and graphic design major in 2015. This includes various classes such as web design, digital culture, animation, and more.

        <p class="sectionsubtag textsmall">Digital media takes several different forms, such as email, video, websites, photos, and slideshows. In a study done by Alison Cook-Sather, students tend to be more comfortable with communicating by e-mail. Emails allow direct communication with a student and teacher outside the classroom. Students can have dialogue at any time with their professors on problems or questions they are having. this allows students and teachers to advance communication techniques even out of the classroom. Through visual presentations students and professors can put forth their information with video and photo for context or engagement. Showcasing their topic through video and photo has become a major tool in the classroom for more visual learners. For example, in an article by Jon M. Wargo and Kara Clayton, U.S. secondary students amplified by a global political climate of fear, oppression, and increased nationalism, used multimodal composition, and video production in particular, as a means to participate in politics and voice their opinion.</p>

        <p class="sectionsubtag textsmall"> Through video production students were able to create a message and display it to a larger audience. The study showed that presenting information in the form of a video production increased student interactions with the assignment.[5] Students felt more in control of their work, and production process allowed for them to voice their own opinions. Through the internet and websites like Google Classroom, Canvas, Blackboard, Slack, Discord, students, ands professors can obtain and share information and assignments in one place. this use of digital media in education allows students to access more useful information, communicate and, find opportunities all inside there classes. As time has passed different forms of digital media, such as laptops, video, and online research have been incorporated into daily education.</p>
